> ### Overview

#### `So here's the thing about your keyboard:**It's yours.**`

When you sit down behind the wheel of a new car, the first thing you do is probably slide the seat so it's the right distance from the pedals. Then you adjust the mirrors, maybe change the angle of the steering wheel, until the car works with_your_body.

With most keyboards, you just place your fingers on the keys, and, well, that's about it. Not much else you can do. But unless you're a professional driver, you probably spend way more time typing than you do driving. We think**your keyboard should adapt to your body, not the other way around**.

![ErgoDox EZ keyboard](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1152/3264/files/ergodox_ez_08_1024x1024.jpg?5613299318556748972)

That's why everything about the ErgoDox EZ is customizable:

*   The keyboard is made up of two separate halves, which you can position independently. Why hunch over a keyboard when you can place your hands at shoulder width? Heck, you can even go all_Star Trek_and mount the halves on the handles of your chair ("make it so!").
*   We developed a custom**Tilt/Tent kit**composed of six legs that allow you to adjust the angle of the keyboard until it's perfect.
*   The**feel**of the keyboard is customisable, right down to how hard you have to press each key, and whether or not it clicks. We offer a choice of seven different keyswitch types, each with a different feel. Make it retro-clicky or silky smooth, it's up to you.
*   You can pick the**keycaps**that are right for you. Do you touch type and like the stark minimalism of an all-black, blank keyboard? Our blank, sculpted keycaps would be perfect for you. Of course, there's also a model with beautifully printed keycaps.
*   You can**move the keys around**. Don't like where the Space key is? No problem! Turn another key into Space, or change the letters around for an alternative layout. Our open-source firmware lets you customize the keyboard itself.
*   You can make even better use of easy-to-reach keys with**dual-function keys**, an advanced ErgoDox EZ feature that allows you to use a key as both a letter (say, z) and a modifier (Ctrl, Alt, or anything else). This is just an example, there is much more you can do with our open-source Quantum software.
*   The ErgoDox EZ is**made to last**, with uncompromising build quality, a housing that's reinforced with metal where it meets the tilt/tent kit, and a generous two-year warranty. This is a keyboard you're going to be using for years to come.

The ErgoDox EZ isn't a keyboard for everyone: It's the keyboard for**you**.

#### `How we make our keyboards`

![Taiwan Team](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1152/3264/t/25/assets/neat-taiwan-team.jpg?17225678919898917123)

Our keyboards are made in Taiwan by people who are employees, not contractors. People who get overtime, benefits, and paid holidays. Thatâ€™s why around Chinese New Year our lead times always go up â€” because the people making the board get to spend time with their families.

It is made at an office building, not a factory. The conditions are good, and it is highly skilled labor with commensurate pay.
